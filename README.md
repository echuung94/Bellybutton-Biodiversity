# Bellybutton Biodiversity 

## Overview 
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

Rosa needed assistance in creating a visualization for the bacterial data for each volunteer. Her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. Using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, we created a bar chart and a bubble chart to display the information when a specific ID was selected, and a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value.
